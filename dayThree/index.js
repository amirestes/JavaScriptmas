/* Challenge 1: Favorite Foods
- Topic: Object Destructuring
1. Edit the faveFoods object so that it contains 
your favorite foods.
2. Destructure the faveFoods object into three consts: 
breakfast, lunch, and supper.
3. Fetch the meals <section> from the DOM.

4. Set the innerHTML content of the meals <section> to a paragraph
that states what your favorite foods are for breakfast, lunch, and supper.
Use a template literal to construct the string.

E.g.
For breakfast, I only like croissants ü•ê. For lunch, I love pasta üçù, 
and for supper I want usually want pizza üçï.

const faveFoods = {
    breakfast: 'French Toast',
    lunch: 'Tacos',
    supper: 'Sushi'
}

const breakfast = faveFoods.breakfast;
const lunch = faveFoods.lunch;
const supper = faveFoods.supper;
let meals = document.getElementById("meals");

meals.innerHTML = `<p>For breakfast, I only like ${breakfast}. For lunch, I love ${lunch}, and for supper I usually want ${supper}</p>`
